# Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this project, I have used the two common deep RL algorithms deep q-learning and policy gradients to solve the 
OpenAI gym environment "cartpole-v0". I have performed some hyperparameter tuning for both 
approaches with the goal of achieving a good performance and to determine which hyperparameters 
are important for this particular environment.

In order to see which experiments have been performed, open the Jupyer notebook DRL.ipynb. If you want to run the 
experiments yourself, be advised that running the whole notebook will take a significant amount of
time (several hours on a GTX 1080). 

Running the notebook has the following prerequisites:
- Python 3
- keras
- TensorFlow

All other necessary files are included in the project folders. 

A writeup of the whole project is available in the file deepRL.pdf

The files logz.py and plot.py have
taken from UC Berkeley's course on deep reinforcement learning, homework 2, available on 
https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework/tree/master/hw2 .
